## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all the assignments completed during the **Data Visualization** course. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of data visualization, aiming to develop a deep understanding of how to represent data effectively.

## Course Overview

The Data Visualization course covered the following topics:

1. Introduction to Data Visualization
2. Principles of Good Visualization
3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
4. Visualization with Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
5. Interactive Visualizations (Plotly, Dash)
6. Advanced Visualization Techniques
7. Storytelling with Data

## Homework Assignments

Each homework assignment is contained within its own directory and includes the following:

- **Homework 1**: [Interactive Bar Chart](HW1)  
  Created using Plotly and Dash. This assignment involves an interactive bar chart that allows users to explore data dynamically.

- **Homework 2**: [Heatmap and Line Chart](HW2)  
  Utilized Plotly to create a heatmap and a line chart. The heatmap represents daily trees planted in Sud Ouest in 2017, and the accompanying line chart visualizes the trends over time.

- **Homework 3**: [Bubble Chart](HW3)  
  Developed using Plotly and Dash. This assignment features a bubble chart illustrating the relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions, providing insights into economic and environmental factors.

- **Homework 4**: [Scatter Map of Pedestrian Paths](HW4)  
  Implemented with Plotly and Dash. This scatter map displays the geographical locations and types of pedestrian paths in Montreal. It includes interactive tooltips showing each borough's name and path, and an informational panel appears when each marker is clicked.


## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies were used throughout the course:

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and visualization
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- **Seaborn**: Library for making statistical graphics
- **Plotly**: Library for creating interactive plots
- **Dash**: Framework for building interactive web applications
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing environment

## Setup Instructions

To run the code provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
